# K-Means-Clustering-using-R

In **Unsupervised Learning** we have different type of algorithms such as:
1. Clustering
2. Association Rules
3. Recommendation Engine
4. PCA
5. Text mining
6. NLP


In **Clustering** we have :
1. Hierarchial Clustering
2. K-Means Clustering
3. DBSCAN Clustering

In this repository we will discuss mainly about *K-Means Clustering*


  step 1: K= 3, we can take different values for K, here K=3 so entire data is randomly divided in to 3 parts need not be equal.\
  step 2: Centroid computation - calculate centroid for each part.\
  step 3: find distance from centroid to all datapoints in each part.\
  step 4: Move data point in to nearest centroid.\
  step 5: Recompute centroids.\
  step 6: Repeat steps from 3 to 5 until there is no need to move data points from one cluster to other cluster.
  
  
  By using Elbow graph or screw plot we will decide proper K-value.
  
  
  **Advantages:**
  
  1. Partition of data accurately fast
  2. Suitable for larger datasets
  
  
  **Diasadvantages:**
  
  1. If we have outliers, it will give false clusters

## Data used:
          universities : Clustering of similar universities,
          crime_data : Clustering of Murderers based on their similarity ,
          EastWestAirlines : Clustering of Airlines based on their similarity


##  Programming:
           R-Programming


**The Codes regarding this K-Means Clustering with three different business problems *Clustering of uiversities* ,*Clustering of murderers*, *Clustering of Airlines* with their datasets are present in this Repository in detail**
